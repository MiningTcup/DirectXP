# DirectXP

Have you ever killed a mob, but not been able to reach the XP? Perhaps you mined a block, but your friend stepped before you and took your XP. This plugin makes it so that when you break a block or kill a mob, all XP, in the default amount, is instantly transferred to you. It can also prevent that cloud of XP orbs from your enderman farm.

Tested in CraftBukkit, Spigot, and Paper 1.21.3, probably works in, like, everything.
